    <h1>
        History of Technology
    </h1>
    <p>
        time of systematic techniques for making and doing things. The term technology, a combination of the Greek
        technē, “art,
        craft,” with logos, “word, speech,” meant in Greece a discourse on the arts, both fine and applied. When it
        first
        appeared in English in the 17th century, it was used to mean a discussion of the applied arts only, and
        gradually these
        “arts” themselves came to be the object of the designation. By the early 20th century the term embraced a
        growing range
        of means, processes, and ideas in addition to tools and machines. By mid-century technology was defined by such
        phrases
        as “the means or activity by which man seeks to change or manipulate his environment.” Even such broad
        definitions have
        been criticized by observers who point out the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between scientific
        inquiry and
        technological activity.

    <h2>
        General considerations
    </h2>
    <p>
        Essentially, techniques are methods of creating new tools and products of tools, and the capacity for
        constructing
        such
        artifacts is a determining characteristic of humanlike species. Other species make artifacts: bees build
        elaborate
        hives
        to deposit their honey, birds make nests, and <a href="nowhere">beavers</a> build dams. But these attributes are
        the result of
        patterns of
        instinctive behaviour and cannot be varied to suit rapidly changing circumstances. Human beings, in contrast to
        other
        species, do not possess highly developed instinctive reactions but do have the capacity to think systematically
        and
        creatively about techniques. Humans can thus innovate and consciously modify the environment in a way no other
        species
        has achieved. An ape may on occasion use a stick to beat bananas from a tree, but a person can fashion the stick
        into a
        cutting tool and remove a whole bunch of bananas. Somewhere in the transition between the two, the hominid, the
        first
        humanlike species, emerges. By virtue of humanity’s nature as a toolmaker, humans have therefore been
        technologists
        from
        the beginning, and the history of technology encompasses the whole evolution of humankind.
